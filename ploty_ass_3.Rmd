Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!


```{r cars}

library(plotly)
plot_ly(x=mtcars$wt,y=mtcars$mpg,z=mtcars$hp,type="scatter3d", 
        mode="markers", color=mtcars$wt)
```
